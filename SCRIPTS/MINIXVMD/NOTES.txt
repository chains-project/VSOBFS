NOTE we do not need to be able to build on all potentially possible
platforms, just on a "sufficiently wide" choice of independent OS,
toolchains and hardware, to be able to cross-verify and trust the
builds. It can become relevant to add adjustments to the scripts and
patches, to allow builds with different tools on new platforms, but the
resulting disk files and disk images do not depend on the tools.
