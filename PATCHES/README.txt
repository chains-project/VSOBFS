patch.suspected.comparebug  - a correction for a table in ACK but the code
                              produced via this table does not seem to
                              be used (optimized away?)

patch.tinycc_tendrify       - make TinyCC source palatable to the
                              ANSI/C89 TenDRA compiler, the latter also
                              has to be built with its experimental
                              support for 64-bit
